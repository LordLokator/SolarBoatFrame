## Articles / repos
- **Maritime AI Projects**
  - [**Buoy-Detection**](https://github.com/nimbekarnd/Buoy-Detection-GMM-/tree/main)
    - "The aim is to detect the buoys from the input video and using the proper color segmentation techniques detect the buoy."
    - Amateur-ish but could be useful

  - [**DTU Maritime Dataset with Mask R-CNN**](https://github.com/Allopart/Maritme_Mask_RCNN/tree/master)
    - "This repository tries to simplify the process of creating a Dataset and training Mask R-CNN from scratch. Specifically, a maritime dataset of 176 images is created which include 5 classes: buoys (green), land (red), sea (dark blue), sky (turquoise) and ships (white)."
    - Only trained on <200 images but Mask R-CNN is very powerful.
    - If useful but not accuracte enough, check for dataset and use the provided training scripts.
