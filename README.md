# üõ†Ô∏è SolarBoat Framework

This repository contains the **Autonomous Ship Control Framework**, a modular system designed to seamlessly connect and manage dedicated sensors, the CAN bus, actuators, communication modules (e.g., 4G), GPS, and a decision-making module. This framework acts as the backbone for orchestrating autonomous ship operations in real-world and simulated environments.

We based our implementation on the work [[1]](#1) of Tomera M. and Alfuth ≈Å.

## üåü Core Objectives
### Version 0:
- [x] **Ship Coordinate System & Navigation Math**
  - Convert GPS coordinates to Earth/body-fixed frames.
  - Compute heading and cross-track errors (Eq. 4, 41, 46).
- [x] **GPS Integration**
  - Real-time GPS tracking with NED offsets and geofence safety.
- [x] **Waypoint Navigation Controller**
  - PDPI control algorithm as described in [1].
- [x] **ShipPosition Class**
  - Centralized source for position, heading, velocity vectors (`eta`, `nu`, `U`).
- [x] **Threaded GPS Update Loop**
  - Background polling for position updates.
- [x] **Clean CANManager Interface**
  - Message receiving via background thread and `read_state()` access.
- [x] **Modular Architecture (ShipState / ShipTaskManager)**
  - Separates state handling from control logic.

> [!WARNING]
> 4G is notoriously unstable near borders. Take extra care.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] **Route Management in ShipState**
  - Automatic segment switching and waypoint arrival logic.
- [ ] **ShipTaskManager Control Loop**
  - Generate rudder/engine commands via PDPI based on state.
- [ ] **CAN Protocol Finalization**
  - Implement exact message layout for incoming/outgoing data.

### üöÄ Upcoming Features:
- [ ] **Path History Logging**
  - Store past position, heading, and error metrics.
- [ ] **Testing & Replay Tools**
  - Replay logs for testing controller behavior.
- [ ] **Simulated GPS / CAN Sources**
  - Offline testing with mocked hardware input.
- [ ] **Web UI or CLI Dashboard**
  - Real-time monitoring and override tools.

## Setup

You need root privileges for the setupper.

1. Make the setup bash script executable:
      ```bash
      sudo chmod +x setup_env.sh
      ```

2. python main.py is the entry point.

---

## Testing

From the root, use this command in terminal:


  ```python
  pytest tests/
  ```

To create a file 'tree.txt' with the project layout, use this command in the project root:

```
tree -I 'documentation|__pycache__|tests|tree.txt' --noreport > tree.txt
```
