# 🛠️ SolarBoat Framework

This repository contains the **Autonomous Ship Control Framework**, a modular system designed to seamlessly connect and manage dedicated sensors, the CAN bus, actuators, communication modules (e.g., 4G), GPS, and a decision-making module. This framework acts as the backbone for orchestrating autonomous ship operations in real-world and simulated environments.

We based our implementation on the work [[1]](#1) of Tomera M. and Alfuth Ł.

## 🌟 Core Objectives

### Version 0:
- [ ] **CAN Bus Management**:
  - Handle communication between actuators and end devices on the CAN bus.
- [ ] **Sensor Integration**:
  - Connect and test sensors.
- [ ] **Decision-Making Module**:
  - Orchestrates autonomous navigation and control of the vehicle.
- [ ] **Communication Channels**:
  - Enable communication via 4G for real-time data transfer.

> [!WARNING]
> 4G is notoriously unstable near borders. Take extra care.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

### 🚀 Upcoming Features:
- [ ] **Modular Sensor Drivers**:
  - Add drivers for more specialized sensors and dynamic configuration.
- [ ] **4G Redundancy**:
  - Introduce failover mechanisms for robust communication.
- [ ] **GPS Data Enrichment**:
  - Fuse GPS data with additional telemetry for better localization.
- [ ] **Simulation Support**:
  - Create hooks for Unreal Engine or other simulators to test the framework.

## Setup

You need root privileges for the setupper.

1. Make the setup bash script executable:
      ```bash
      sudo chmod +x setup_env.sh
      ```

2. python main.py is the entry point.

---

## Testing

From the root, use this command in terminal:


  ```python
  pytest tests/
  ```
